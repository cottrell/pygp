*This is a bastardized version of some of my earlier GP code. Eventually this
will slowly replicate and extend that code, but in the meanwhile this code
exists so that I can actually get things done. (Note the 2 above!)*

`pygp` is a python package for inference with Gaussian processes.

The goal is for this to be a relatively self-contained python package for using
Gaussian Processes (GPs) that is loosely based on Carl Rasmussen's `GPML`
toolbox. Here "loosely" means that some of the structure and ideas are based on
that toolbox's implementations, but some changes have been made to make this
package somewhat more pythonic.
