----

A Python package for inference with Gaussian processes.

The goal is for this to be a relatively self-contained python package for using
Gaussian Processes (GPs) that is loosely based on Carl Rasmussen's `GPML`
toolbox. The structure and ideas are based on that toolbox's implementations,
but some changes have been made to make this package more pythonic.
