A Python package for inference with Gaussian processes.

The goal is for this to be a relatively self-contained python package for using
Gaussian Processes (GPs) that is loosely based on Carl Rasmussen's `GPML`
toolbox. Here "loosely" means that some of the structure and ideas are based on
that toolbox's implementations, but some changes have been made to make this
package somewhat more pythonic.
